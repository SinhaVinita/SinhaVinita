👋 Hi, I’m @SinhaVinita. 
<!-- Check out my work at [vinitasinha.com](https://vinitasinha.com)! -->

👀 **I’m interested in tech, research, and product management.** ~~When I'm not busy building core manufacturing applications for self-driving cars @ *Tesla*, you can find me fine-tuning BERT models, painting, or biking around the Bay Area.~~ When I'm not busy building out Portfolio Management and Trading applications @ *Fidelity Investments*, you can find me canoeing and hyper-focused coding in cafes in the Research Triangle Park, NC.

🎓 I graduated from Cornell University with a degree in Computer Science and Data Science. I have worked as a TA, mentor, and undergrad researcher with focus on NLP and ML.

🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about LLM research and would love to make any kind of contribution to the embeddings learning space. 
     I'm also currently reading up on DeepSeek's paper.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bringing to life **projects with a vision!** With 5+ years of industry experience in tech, I like to focus on defining and building the product from scratch, as well as drawing a success roadmap for my team ✨
