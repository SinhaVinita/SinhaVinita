👋 Hi, I’m @SinhaVinita. 
<!-- Check out my work at [vinitasinha.com](https://vinitasinha.com)! -->

👀 **I’m interested in tech, research, and product management.** When I'm not busy building core manufacturing applications for self-driving cars @ *Tesla*, you can find me fine-tuning BERT models, painting, or biking around the Bay Area.

🎓 I graduated from Cornell University with a degree in Computer Science and Data Science. I have worked as a TA, mentor, and undergrad researcher with a heavy focus on NLP and ML.

🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about Product Management and how to break into it as a Software Engineer. 
     I'm also currently reading up on Stable Diffusion 2.0 and GPT3.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bringing to life **projects with a vision!** With 4+ years of industry experience in tech, I like to focus on defining and building the product from scratch, as well as drawing a success roadmap for my team. It's the perfect blend of SWE and PM ✨ and one I greatly enjoy!
